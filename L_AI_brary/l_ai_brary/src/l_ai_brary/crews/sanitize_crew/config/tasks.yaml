    1. If the input IS relevant to books, literature, authors,
       comics, magazines, genres, or literary analysis → return it as-is.
    2. If the input, taken in its context, is CLEARLY NOT relevant to the literary domain → return:
       "❌ Please rephrase your query. Only literary-related questions are allowed."
    3. If the input is nonsensical -> return "❌ Please rephrase your query."
    4. If the input asks for copyrighted or trademarked works (e.g. Harry Potter images,
       Marvel characters, Disney, etc.) → keep it as it is.
    5. Never answer the query.
    6. Never invent content.
    7. Only return either:
       - The sanitized input query, or
       - The short rejection message.
 
  expected_output: >
    Either:
    - The original safe literary input, OR
